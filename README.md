Creating User stories is an important part of the development lifecycle. When talking to users about the products, you can take their suggestions or feedback and turn them into individual stories for the Scrum team to complete based on important. Creating User Stories gives a sense of a starting point for each task and allows the team to decide who works on what. Incorporating Scrum teams and daily sprints seems like a very useful part of agile that could really help future projects. Daily Sprints allow for the entire team to constantly be communicating about what they are working on to make sure people are all on the same page. I think that being a good team member in software development is to be respectful and have good communication with your team. Performing your individual role on the team and asking for help when stuck are also big parts of being good team members.
